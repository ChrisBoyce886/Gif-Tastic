# GIF-Tastic

This project is my Unit 6 homework submission for UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.  

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive webpage to display GIF's using the Giphy API, AJAX calls, and Javascript & jQuery 
library to dynamically update the DOM.

## Design Notes

* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 12 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page
using JavaScript & jQuery.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif plays. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
* If on a desktop browser, each gif displays its rating below it.  
* Each button clicked prepends the next set of gifs to the top of the page.
* The user can also search Giphy's entire library of gifs using the search box at the top of the page. When a searched is entered, it 
creates a new button on the page, and when clicked, shows the user another set of gifs based on the subject of that search parameter. 
* The user can add as any buttons as they would like.
